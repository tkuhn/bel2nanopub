BEL2nanopub Examples
====================

This directory contains some examples of BEL files and their representations as
nanopublications.

The files ending in `.bel` are the original BEL files. `.nanopubs.trig` are the
resulting nanopublications in TriG format. For comparison, `.ttl` is the RDF
representation as produced by OpenBEL's bel.rb tool in Turtle format.
