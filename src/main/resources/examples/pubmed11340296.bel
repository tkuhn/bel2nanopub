# Set the Citation for the Document. This is generally used to define who
# created the document.

# Set additional information for the Document. This is generally used to define why
# the document was created and what it can be used for.

# Definitions Section
# This section is used to define the Namespaces and Annotation Types which will 
# be used within the document.
#

# First define the Namespaces for term parameters. One Namespace can be set as 
# the DEFAULT Namespace for the document
DEFINE DEFAULT NAMESPACE HGNC AS URL \
" http://resource.belframework.org/belframework/1.0/ns/hgnc-approved-\ symbols.belns"
DEFINE NAMESPACE EGID AS URL \
" http://resource.belframework.org/belframework/1.0/ns/entrez-gene-ids-hmr.belns"

# Next define Annotation Types to be used to annotate the BEL Statements that are 
# defined later on

# Here we set up a species annotation using the pre-defined species annotation available 
# on BELSCRIPT. This species annotation uses NCBI TAX IDs
DEFINE ANNOTATION_TYPE Species AS URL \
    " http://resource.belframework.org/belframework/1.0/annotation/species.belanno"
# Define a Tissues annotation type
DEFINE ANNOTATION_TYPE Tissue AS LIST{"t-cells"}
# Define an ExposureTime Annotation Type using a REGEX pattern
DEFINE ANNOTATION_TYPE ExposureTime AS PATTERN "[0-6]hr"

#
# Statements Section
# This section is used to encode BEL Statements using the Namespaces and 
# Annotation Types previously defined.
#

# Set the citation for the PubMed article being used. The Citation and EvidenceLine 
# Annotation types are part of the BEL specification and don't need to be defined as 
# Annotation Types
SET Citation = {"Exp Clin Immunogenet, 2001;18(2) 80-5", "PUBMED", "11340296"}

# Set document-defined annotation values
SET Species = 9606
SET Tissue = "t-cells"

# Create an Evidence Line for a block of BEL Statements
SET EvidenceLine = "Here we show that interfereon-alpha (IFNalpha) is a potent producer \
    of SOCS expression in human T cells, as high expression of CIS, SOCS-1, SOCS-2, \
and SOCS-3 was detectable after IFNalpha stimulation. After 4 h of stimulation \
CIS, SOCS-1, and SOCS-3 had returned to baseline levels, whereas SOCS-2 \
expression had not declined."

SET ExposureTime = "4hr"

# Create some BEL Statements. The following statements will be annotated with Citation,
# Species, Tissue, EvidenceLine and ExposureTime annotation type values defined above.
